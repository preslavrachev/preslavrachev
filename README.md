# Hi, I'm Preslav.

![Preslav Rachev speaking at PyConWeb 2019](https://preslav.me/img/preslav_hu752f8e7becab6a21e985cd5baa3fbb5f_71955_1320x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)

I am a software engineer with around a decade behind my back, developing data-intensive software systems and applications. I have recently started work on my independent business, focusing on education (books, courses, etc) and building my own products and services. I am also helping small teams bring their ideas to market. If you are in need of technical guidance or mentoring, feel free to [get in touch](https://tally.so/r/mOavMw).

Besides my pure developer duties, I advocate for a strong culture among software developers, indie hackers, and solopreneurs - whether through [my blog](https://preslav.me), or speaking at various events. I am an avid reader, a distance runner, and a hobby musician.

Being a genuinely curious individual, I always keep an eye on challenging problems I could help solve. If yours is one of those, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. Want to get in touch? No problem! Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev). Follow right away or send me a direct message. I am also on [Telegram](https://t.me/preslavrachev), [Medium](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preslavrachev/).
