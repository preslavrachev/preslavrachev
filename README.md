### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer with around a decade behind my back, developing data-intensive software systems and backend applications. I am currently partnering with [KI labsâ€™](https://www.ki-labs.com/) diverse team of data and software-aficionados. Besides my pure developer duties, I build my own products and services, and advocate for a strong culture among software-preneurs - whether through [my blog](https://preslav.me), or speaking at various events.

I am an avid reader, a distance runner, and a hobby musician.

Being a genuinely curious individual, I always keep an eye on challenging problems I could help solve. If yours is one of those, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. Want to get in touch? No problem! Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev). Follow right away or send me a direct message. I am also on [Telegram](https://t.me/preslavrachev), [Medium](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preslavrachev/).
